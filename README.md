About
=====

A very patient guitar tutor. It has a tune that it would like you to play but it's prepared to wait.

Patiently waits for you to play the right note, then records it and moves on to the next note.

Once it's all done, it plays back the recording and HEY PRESTO you seem to have played 
a fluent and rapid rendition of The Flight of the Bumblebee!

The audio infrastructure used is [SuperCollider-Android](http://github.com/glastonbridge/SuperCollider-Android)

* [Dan Stowell](http://www.mcld.co.uk/)

Incorporating some code by [Alex Shaw](http://www.glastonbridge.com/) developed during the ScanVox project.

The project also uses much code from the main [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) codebase,
created by James McCartney and with many co-authors.

Was developed in under 24 hours for Music Hack Day London 2010....... 
...then later on it took some more time to make it actually work on the device.
